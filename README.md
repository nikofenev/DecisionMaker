# DecisionMaker
Mack's team's project for JavaEE fall 2017.

# Problem Statement

Our problem is that the magic eight ball is outdated and we want something that could be crude or not, indecisive or not
and if you want an irritated answer if you irritated or not. Well the magic eight ball doesn't offer that functionality, that's why 
we are making an application that people can call and you can tell it if you want an answer for something depending on what your feeling.

# The Solution

We are going to make a decision maker for people who want an answer and cant come up with something either clever or anything at all.
but there's a kick, in our we have three choices to add to your decision to make it that much better! You can either choose to have a little 
crudeness in the answer, or an indecisive answer to give it to someone you don't like or don't want to talk to. Lastly you can add a little
 irritated-ness to the answer if your not feeling what you are doing or don't again want to talk to someone.

# Widget Use Instructions
Widget General Overview -- all necessary parts to run the Decision Maker on your web page are included in the 'UI_parts' 
folder in this repository. The design of the widget will work on all web pages regardless of the server-side language used. 
All calls are made and received through JavaScript.

Step 1: Add the required links for Bootstrap and jQuery libraries. These links are included in the 'CDN_includesForUI.txt' file. 
Add the code lines to head section of any page intended to include the Decision Maker widget.

Step 2: Add the HTML div containing the widget code to your web page. The code for this div is in the file 'UserInterfaceCode.txt'.
The div is bootstrap responsive.

Step 3: Add some minor CSS code for the widget. This code is in the 'customCssForUI.txt'. To use the code, create a file
called decisionMaker.css in a folder called css.

Step 4: Add the JavaScript required to access the Decision Maker API. This code is in the 'RequiredJavaScript.txt' file. To use the code, 
create a Javascript file called 'decisionMaker.js' inside a folder named 'js'. Paste the Javascript code in the file.

Step 5: Enjoy a life of easy decision making. Once the preceding four steps are complete you are ready to go. Use the Decision Maker to make your 
life easier--and totally mindless. Just remember, the Decision Maker is for entertainment purposes only. Even though the creators of
fully believe in the quality of the advice given by the Decision Maker, we take no responsibly for any mishaps caused in part or in whole by its use--or misuse.
